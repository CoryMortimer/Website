When defining variables, it is best to use `const` wherever possible. The `const` keyword signals to the next developer that the variable will not be reassigned. This reduces the amount of context that the developer needs to keep track of.

Below is a contrived example only using the `let` keyword to declare and define variables:

```
let myFunction = () => {
  let a = 1
  let b = 2
  let c = 3
  let d = 4
  let r

  a = a + b + c + d

  r = `The result is ${a}`

  return r
}
```

Here is the above example using `const` and `let` where appropriate:

```
const myFunction = () => {
  let a = 1
  const b = 2
  const c = 3
  const d = 4
  let r

  a = a + b + c + d

  r = `The result is ${a}`

  return r
}
```

In the second example, the `const` keyword frees up mental capacity allowing developers to understand the code more quickly and to think about opportunities to improve the code.
